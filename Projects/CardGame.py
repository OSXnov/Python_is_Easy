# Project #3: Pick a Card Game!


# Details:
 
#  Everyone has their favorite card game. What's yours? For this assignment, choose a card game (other than Blackjack),
#  and turn it into a Python program. It doesn't matter if it's a 1-player game, or a 2 player game, or more! 
#  That's totally up to you. A few requirements:

# It's got to be a card game (no board games, etc)
# When the game starts up, you should ask for the players' names. 
# And after they enter their names, your game should refer to them by name only. ("It's John's turn" instead of "It's player 1's turn). 
# At any point during the game, someone should be able to type "--help" to be taken to a screen where they can read the rules of the game and instructions for how to play. 
# After they're done reading, they should be able to type "--resume" to go back to the game and pick up where they left off.
